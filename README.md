# Spacebook UI

This is the User Interface for Spacebook - Mobile App Development Assignment 2021/2022.

I have used React Native CLI. For coding standards and to minimise errors, I have used a built in Eslint plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
I have used Google and airBnB style guides.

To get the UI started, read and follow the following below steps.

If any issues please contact me Tasmia Niazi (18062215@stu.mmu.ac.uk).
